PUT: Update existing author details, enabling modifications to the name, bio, or any other relevant information.
DELETE: Remove an author from the database based on their unique identifier, handling associated book records appropriately.
Relationships:

Establish and manage relationships between books and authors, ensuring accurate retrieval and representation of data.
Validation and Error Handling:

Implement robust validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages.
POSTMAN Integration:

Provide a comprehensive POSTMAN collection with pre-configured requests for each API endpoint.
Utilize POSTMAN environments for easy switching between development, testing, and production environments.
Outcome: The Book Management API, enhanced by the capabilities of POSTMAN, offers a user-friendly and efficient way to manage, retrieve, and manipulate information about books and authors. With support for various HTTP methods, the API ensures flexibility and ease of integration for developers and systems interacting with the book management system. The POSTMAN collection simplifies testing and usage, making the API a powerful tool for book-related operations in diverse applications and environments.
